Paired Programming project of a clone of Venom. 

We used a JSON web token to authenticate users to login, be able to view their blance, transfer funds to other users, and view past transfers.

We used Microsoft SQL server to create a database to store user login, to update their balance, and to save their transfer history. 

We utilized the Model-View-Controller patter and DAO pattern to retrieve information from the database and display it to the user. We used parameterized SQL queries to retrive the information from the SQL database. 

Planned future functionality includes allowing users to request funds from other users and to acccept or decline such requests.
